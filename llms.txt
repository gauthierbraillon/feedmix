# feedmix

> Aggregate your YouTube subscriptions into a lightweight terminal feed. A privacy-focused RSS alternative for developers who prefer the command line.

## What it does

feedmix is a CLI tool that:
- Authenticates with YouTube via OAuth 2.0 (browser-based, tokens stored locally)
- Fetches recent videos from all your YouTube subscriptions
- Displays them as a clean terminal feed with titles, channels, timestamps, and clickable URLs

## Who it is for

- Developers who live in the terminal and want YouTube subscription updates without opening a browser
- Privacy-conscious users who want a lightweight RSS-like experience without third-party services
- Users who want a single binary that runs anywhere Go runs
